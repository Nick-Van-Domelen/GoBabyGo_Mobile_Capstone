        Aishwarya: design review presentation
        Evie: build starter flutter project
        Nicholas: build starter flask project
        Christien: build starter flask project, Design Review presentation
        Thomas: initialize and setup github 

Scrum record:

        Aishwarya: Having issues creating a path to my flutter folder so I am unable to run any flutter commands.

        Evie: 
            So far I have been able to create a Rest API using Flask and have been able to call that information using flutter. I am stuck on converting that information into a string that I can display to the application screen. 

        Nicholas: 
            accomplishments: Successfully create a dart/Flutter application on an android device. 
            Concerns: connecting our Flask database to Google Cloud services and being able to successfully make calls to it. 
            Roadblocks: Google cloud services

        Christien: 
            I was able to get a Flask API connecting to a front end. Added presentation notes to much of Design Review power point and filled out Perceived Challenges/Technical Hurdles. My biggest road block will be integrating Google Cloud services to our frontend and backend.

        Thomas: 
            I was able to successfuly set up the github and get the program running on my IOS machine. I was also able to install all of the necessary software onto my local machine. The only percieved roadblocks are getting this running for all of our members individually on their machines, and getting funding settled for cloud integration.
